**OT(OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY) SECURITY**
---

Practices and technologies used to (a) protect people, assets, and information, (b) monitor and/or control physical devices, processes and events.

***OT VS IT***
---

IT deals with data processing while OT deals with controllong of machines etc.
IT uses standard protocol while OT uses propriotory protocol.

Why is ot at risk :

-IT OT convergance leads to efficiency but connects it to the internet thus opening up risks.

**THREATS**
---

Threats beacuse of malware, elxternal attacks and from lack of management and security awareness.


Challenges in OT Security:

    Lack of Skills in Security Operations Center (SOC): Not enough people are trained to handle security operations effectively.

    Constant Changing Tactics: The tactics used by attackers keep evolving and are hard to predict.

    Need for Different Tools: There is no single tool or set of skills that can detect all types of threats. We need various tools.

    Passive and Manual Tools: Some security tools cannot automatically respond to threats, and they need human intervention.

    Old Equipment Exposes Endpoints: Outdated equipment can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

  **PLOP**
  ---

   PLOP is an acronym that represents different aspects you need to consider when securing a computer or industrial system:

    P stands for People: Consider the training and roles of the people involved in the system's security.

    L stands for Layers: Think about the different layers of security you can put in place, like passwords, firewalls, and antivirus software.

    O stands for Objects: This refers to the devices and software within the system that need to be protected.

    P stands for Platforms: Consider the underlying technologies and systems that support your computer or industrial setup.

By addressing these four aspects (People, Layers, Objects, and Platforms), you can create a well-rounded and effective security strategy for your system.

 **PROTOCOLS**
 ---
 
 OT uses modbus, DNP3 and OPC3
 whereas IT used HTTP AND TCIP/ip
 
 **ACCESS CONTROL**
 ---
 Restricts who can access and modify the systems . It involves the use of authentication ,authorization and password login.
 This ensures only the right inviduals can access what is necessary.

 
 **ICS AND SCADA**
 ---
 ICS(Industrial control system) includes in idustries to control and manage various physical activities.
 SCADA(Supervisory control and data acquisition) involves centralised control and management of various sensors and devices.
 
 **Why Target**
 ---
 They control critical infrastructure and can also act as a source for leverage in ransoms.
