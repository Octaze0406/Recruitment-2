**OT(OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY) SECURITY**
---

Practices and technologies used to (a) protect people, assets, and information, (b) monitor and/or control physical devices, processes and events.

***OT VS IT***
---

IT deals with data processing while OT deals with controllong of machines etc.
IT uses standard protocol while OT uses propriotory protocol.

Why is ot at risk :

-IT OT convergance leads to efficiency but connects it to the internet thus opening up risks.

**THREATS**
---

Threats beacuse of malware, elxternal attacks and from lack of management and security awareness.


Challenges in OT Security:

 Lack of Skills in Security Operations Center (SOC): Not enough people are trained to handle security operations effectively.

 Constant Changing Tactics: The tactics used by attackers keep evolving and are hard to predict.
 
 Need for Different Tools: There is no single tool or set of skills that can detect all types of threats. We need various tools.

 Passive and Manual Tools: Some security tools cannot automatically respond to threats, and they need human intervention.

 Old Equipment Exposes Endpoints: Outdated equipment can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    
  **PLOP**
  ---
The principle of least privilege (PoLP) refers to an information security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions. It is widely considered to be a cybersecurity best practice and is a fundamental step in protecting privileged access to high-value data and assets. 

 **PROTOCOLS**
 ---
 
 OT uses modbus, DNP3 and OPC3
 whereas IT used HTTP AND TCIP/ip
 
 **ACCESS CONTROL**
 ---
 Restricts who can access and modify the systems . It involves the use of authentication ,authorization and password login.
 This ensures only the right inviduals can access what is necessary.

 
 **ICS AND SCADA**
 ---
 ICS(Industrial control system) includes in idustries to control and manage various physical activities.
 SCADA(Supervisory control and data acquisition) involves centralised control and management of various sensors and devices.
 
 **Why Target**
 ---
 They control critical infrastructure and can also act as a source for leverage in ransoms.
